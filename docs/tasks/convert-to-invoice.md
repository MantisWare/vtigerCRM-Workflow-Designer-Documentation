Task: Convert to Invoice
===============================================

This task allows you to convert the current Quote or SalesOrder into a Invoice, like the internal routine does.

Additional you could define fields, which you could fill up individually. You have to use this, if you defined custom fields, which should be transfered from the old record into the Invoice.

After the onversation the original Record (Quote/SalesOrder) will NOT be deleted. So you could wait some time and recreate a new Invoice.
