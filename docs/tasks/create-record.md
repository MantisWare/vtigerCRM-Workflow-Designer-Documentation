Task: Create Record/Task/Event
=============================================

You could create records, which don’t have to be related to the record of the workflow.

###### Calender entries

There are special tasks for calendar entries, because they have to be created in a special way

**Because of a different internal handling, you have to enter only the start date in the field "Start date & time"**

#### Environment variables

If you click the link in the task configuration you could enter a environmental variable, which should hold the id of the created record.
This ID could be used later in the workflow.
