Task: manual permission
===========================================

This task allows to stop an automatic workflow and manually choose the path, the record should take.
> **Example**: this allows to check anrecord, before an email will be send*

You could use three different output points for this task to handle three different decisions. (Default: ok/rework/decline)

The text on this task could be changed easily in the configuration.

This task must be connected to an User CRM Object, because the authorization request is bind to one/multiple person/s to allow checks by superior or chief.
Only one user have to set the decision. Probably later a more individual handling will be integrated.

You reach this authorization page over the navigation, like every other module. There will be a link "Workflow2"
