Troubleshooting
==============================

If your Workflow is not executed and you have no idea, whats wrong, I want to give you some hints.

**Is the Workflow activated?**  
 - Only active workflows will be executed. You could check the state on the main panel of Workflow module  
**Did you check the start trigger?**  
 - The default setting is to execute an workflow only on creation of an record.  
 - Also it could be help to resave the start options  
**Have you checked the statistic page?**  
 - You can check, if the execution follows the correct path
